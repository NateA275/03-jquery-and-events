## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 301 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
The domain problem was that we needed to populate selection tags to be able to filter certain articles.
We also need to expand each article when selected wih=th a "read on" button

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
Make it posible to navigate with the tabs.Populate each selector with the aticle and category options. Make a funtion (or functions) that when an article or category is selected to clear the other selection tag.  Make the full article show when the "read on" button is pressed.
